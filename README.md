# Thoughts / Ideas app created in Swift UI

Final Project for my 2020 iOS/Swift Class. The purpose of this app is for users to log their thoughts or ideas. The app will automatically log the location of the user, when writing their idea down(User permissions required). There is much room for improvement in both functionality and ux flow.
